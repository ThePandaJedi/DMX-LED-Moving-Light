# DMX-LED-Moving-Light
Code for an ATMega powered DMX LED Moving Light, using Adafruit Neopixels and two bipolar stepper motors. This code uses the Neopixel library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel), a DMX Library from Toni Merino (http://blog.deskontrol.net/arduino-four-universes-dmx-512-library/), and a modified Arduino hardware serial library from Max Piersomn (http://www.maxpierson.me/2009/03/20/receive-dmx-512-with-an-arduino/).

Requires a more accurate 16 MHz crystal oscillator to run, the ceramic resonator of an Arduino is not capable.
